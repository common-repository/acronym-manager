A plugin to define acronyms in pages, posts and comments site-wide.  Defined acronyms are underlined, and the definition appears as a tool-tip.

== Description ==

A plugin to define acronyms in pages, posts and comments using `<acronym>` or `<abbr>` mark-up.  Defined acronyms are underlined, and the definition appears as a tool-tip if the cursor is placed over the acronym. The list of acronyms is managed through an Admin interface.

This plugin is based on Chris Cox's Acronyms-2, which was itself based on Joel Bennett's Acronym Replacer plugin (http://www.huddledmasses.org/), ported to Nucleus CMS by Joel Pan as the NP_Acronym plugin and now ported back to WordPress.
